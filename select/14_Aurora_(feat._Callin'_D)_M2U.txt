Lift up your voice
Call your soul to be ready for the war
You're the one who'll save us free
Tears in your eyes
Paint the fear of the battle for your dream
I'll be the one who can save us like a tree

Will you let me walk with you
Even let me dive into your life
Don't you dare to ask why
Hold my hand, close your eyes
Make our heart beats so long
Then we can turn this world into a song

Rainbow over the hill
Changes our dreams again
Before the day gets cold
We will go out as I planned
Don't know why you make me cry
Hear me now i'm not giving up for this time
Let's find place for your heart

Lift up your voice
Call your soul to be ready for the war
You're the one who'll save us free
Tears in your eyes
Paint the fear of the battle for your dream
I'll be the one who can save us like a tree

Lift up your voice
Call your soul to be ready for the war
You're the one who'll save us free
Tears in your eyes
Paint the fear of the battle for your dream
I'll be the one who can save us like a tree

Lift up your voice
Call your soul to be ready for the war
You're the one who'll save us free
Tears in your eyes
Paint the fear of the battle for your dream
I'll be the one who can save us like a tree

Cry when you're down
Maybe try not to hide your feelings
Fight, it's all going to be fine
Bring all your tears
Now I'm here
Finding answers to be healed
No matter where life takes you, it isn't too far

Rainbow over the hill
Changes our dreams again
Before the day gets cold
We will go out as I planned
Don't know why you make me cry
Hear me now i'm not giving up for this time
Let's find place for your heart

Lift up your voice
Call your soul to be ready for the war
You're the one who'll save us free
Tears in your eyes
Paint the fear of the battle for your dream
I'll be the one who can save us like a tree

Lift up your voice
Call your soul to be ready for the war
You're the one who'll save us free
Tears in your eyes
Paint the fear of the battle for your dream
I'll be the one who can save us like a tree

Lift up your voice
Call your soul to be ready for the war
You're the one who'll save us free
Tears in your eyes
Paint the fear of the battle for your dream
I'll be the one who can save us like a tree
